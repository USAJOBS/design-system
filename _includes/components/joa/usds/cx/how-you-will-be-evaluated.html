  <h4>Selection process</h4>
  <p>
    If you are found qualified, you will have a chance to learn more about the position at the different agencies hiring.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once an offer is extended to you by an agency and you accept, decline, or do not respond, you are not guaranteed another offer but may receive one from another participating agency. You will be given 72 hours to respond to any offer.
  </p>
  <h4>Future consideration</h4>
  <p>
    If you are not selected for this position you may be considered for similar positions at agencies for up to 1 year.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candidates may be considered for other roles even if you do not formally submit an application (i.e. If you apply as a Customer Experience Strategist but we see potential in your skillset to serve as a Design Strategist, we may consider you for that position based on our own assessment.)
